## GenAI Declaration
I acknowledge the use of Generative AI (Google Gemini) in the development of this exercise.

### How AI was used:
1.  **Concept & Structure:**
    - I ask AI to come up with optimal KNIME workflow to process data
    - I asked AI to suggest a clean folder structure for a web project (separating css, js, assets).
2.  **Code Assistance:**
    - I used AI to suggest which KNIME node should be used and how to config them
    - I used AI to help styling a web project.
    - I used AI to generate dummy data for the "Televisions" table and description.
    - *Note: All code was manually reviewed, tested, and modified by me to fit the assignment requirements.*
